  "shortDescription": "So here it goes! The BLQ theme by bAdGB for FREE! I don’t care about money and these packix fucks can suck my ass, so it’s here for free for everyone. The BLQ Theme has 250+ icons and also comes with 20+ Anemone FX, 4 Time of Day SBHTML widgets, 3 animated gradient backgrounds, and LPP mods. Wallpapers and all, even a respring theme. We renamed a lot of the widgets so it will be easier to match up, added some X sized stuff, and removed some unneeded files, so we *HIGHLY RECOMMEND UNINSTALLING the entire theme so you won’t get duplicates before installing v1.01. Love you all!!!",
